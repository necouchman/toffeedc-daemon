# toffeedc-daemon
This is my attempt to take the TOFFEE-DataCenter code create by Kiran Kankipati and make it more
accessible to the community as a while.  Kiran has stated explicitly on his website that he has
no desire to run a community-driven open source project - he does research, he makes it available,
and he provides consulting services with the code he creates to optimize WAN connections.

I, on the other hand, love community-drive projects, and am attempting to take Kiran's open source
work and build it into a community-driven, WAN acceleration project.  This repository, and the matching
one for the TOFFEE-DataCenter GUI, are sort of my "dipping my toe in the water" as the idiom goes to
see if it's at all feasible to accomplish this and if there's any interest.
